In this tutorial you will learn how to create a SVM (Support Vector Machine) Model in Machine Learning. You will be analyzing species of a flower on parameters of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width 
In this tutorial I have used pre iris dataset from sklearn library. you will also learn about the data visualiztaion techniques , train_test_split method etc.
